# General
- Setup a bedtime switch that will turn off the living room television and lights, and turn on the bedroom TV and lamp
- Turn on/turn off any device at a specified time
- Post NFC tags in various locations and tap your phone on them to trigger automations

# Aquariums
- Automate your feeding schedule
- Automate your lighting schedule
- Check your important smart plugs (filters, heaters) to make sure they're on, and if not, send yourself a notification. You could then keep checking every 30 minutes, and keep notifying you, until you turn the important smart plugs back on.

# Heating & Cooling
- Add a temperature sensor and turn your heaters, air conditioners, etc., off and on as the temperature changes
- Add a humidity sensor and turn your dehumidifier off and on as the humidity changes

# Lighting
- Slowly dim the lights as it gets closer to bedtime
- Create a migraine kill switch that turns off all lights

# Phone
- Keeping your battery between 40% and 80% improves its long-term health. At 40% turn your phone charger's smart plug on and send yourself a notification to plug your phone in, at 80% turn your phone charger's smart plug off.

- Automate your lighting schedule
- Moisture sensors to tell you when your plants need watering

# Presence Detection
- Setup a "Home Zone" around your house and trigger automations when you leave or enter it
- Setup a motion sensor just inside your front door, so when you get home and open your door, the sensor triggers an automation
- Run automations when you get into or out of bed
- Turn on the bathroom light when you walk past a hallway sensor between midnight and 5am

# Robot Vacuum
- Set your vacuum up on a daily schedule for general cleaning

# Television
- Setup a "Theater" automation that you can trigger when you want to watch a movie, that turns the TV on, turns the sound up, turns your living room lights down, etc.

# Weather
- If it's raining, send yourself a notification so you remember to bring an umbrella

# Windows
- Close windows if the outside air quality drops below a certain level
